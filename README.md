# Project-1
## Stock Watchers!
The completed application should meet the following criteria:
* As a user, I can search a stock ticker symbol and get: Current Price, High Price, Low Price, Open, and Previous Close.

* As a user, when I search a stock ticker symbol I will also get the 5 latest news articles.

* I should see my "Watch List" being filled with the stocks that I have searched.

What you should expected to find as a User of the application:
```
WHEN I search for a Stock 
THEN I am presented with the: Current Price, High Price, Low Price, Open, and Previous Close, and 5 latest articles for that stock and that stock is added to the search history
WHEN I view the current stock
THEN I am presented with the stock ticker, current price, high price, low price, open, and previous close, and an icon representation indicating each
WHEN I view the current stock
THEN I am presented with the 5 most recent news articles
WHEN I click on a stock in the Watch List
THEN I am again presented with current stock informaiton and 5 most recent articles
```
